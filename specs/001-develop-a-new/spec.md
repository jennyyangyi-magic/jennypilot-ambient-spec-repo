# Feature Specification: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Feature Name Not Specified]

**Feature Branch**: `001-develop-a-new`
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "blahblahblahblahblah"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí ERROR: "No meaningful feature description provided - only placeholder text"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Unable to identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: All aspects unclear - no feature description provided]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios from placeholder text"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Unable to generate requirements without feature description
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí Unknown if data is involved
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has critical uncertainties - no feature description"
8. Return: BLOCKED (awaiting actual feature description)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: The feature description provided ("blahblahblahblahblah") is placeholder text and does not describe any actual feature. Please provide a real feature description that explains:
- What problem are we solving?
- Who are the users?
- What do users need to accomplish?
- What business value does this provide?]

### Acceptance Scenarios
[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Cannot define acceptance scenarios without understanding the feature requirements]

1. **Given** [unknown initial state], **When** [unknown action], **Then** [unknown expected outcome]

### Edge Cases
[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Cannot identify edge cases without understanding the core feature]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: All functional requirements are undefined due to lack of feature description]

- **FR-001**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: No feature capabilities specified in description]
- **FR-002**: Users MUST be able to [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: No user interactions specified]
- **FR-003**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: No system behaviors specified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Unknown if this feature involves data or what entities would be required]

## Review & Acceptance Checklist
*GATE: Automated checks run during main() execution*

### Content Quality
- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [ ] Focused on user value and business needs - **BLOCKED: No feature description**
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [ ] All mandatory sections completed - **BLOCKED: Awaiting feature description**

### Requirement Completeness
- [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain - **FAIL: All sections require clarification**
- [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous - **BLOCKED: No requirements defined**
- [ ] Success criteria are measurable - **BLOCKED: No success criteria defined**
- [ ] Scope is clearly bounded - **BLOCKED: No scope defined**
- [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified - **BLOCKED: No context provided**

---

## Execution Status
*Updated by main() during processing*

- [x] User description parsed
- [ ] Key concepts extracted - **FAILED: No meaningful content in description**
- [x] Ambiguities marked - **All aspects marked as needing clarification**
- [ ] User scenarios defined - **BLOCKED**
- [ ] Requirements generated - **BLOCKED**
- [ ] Entities identified - **BLOCKED**
- [ ] Review checklist passed - **FAILED**

## Next Steps

**CRITICAL**: This specification cannot proceed to the planning phase without a real feature description.

Please provide:
1. A clear description of what feature you want to build
2. The problem it solves
3. Who the users are
4. What value it provides

Alternatively, if there should be an `rfe.md` file with requirements, please create it or point to its location.
